# LoRa_MQTT
Secure LoRa data Trasmission with MQTT 

Two-way LoRa transmission using heltec wifi lora 32 v2 modules.
The goal is to securely transmit packets by exchanging a simple random key generated by the transmitting device.
The transmission takes place in 4 "stages":
- Request for transmission and random key generation
- Passkey transmission to authorize the transmission
- Transmission of new status and waiting for ACK
- ACK transmission

In case of failure, the transmission is performed 3 times, after which an error is generated and the transmission is abandoned.

devices have been addressed to be individually recognized

The "Master" device is connected to the internet and communicates with the MQTT broker. It can receive commands or send states.
